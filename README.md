# Description

Welcome! Here you can see my [NixOS](https://nixos.org) configuration files in "**functional**" paradigm, which are located in [source](source/) directory.

>Reminder for myself: don't forget to put private keys in `.ssh` folder :)

# Attention

1) Configuration will only work with both CPU and GPU from AMD.
2) Your disk should be split onto two partitions: `vfat:boot` and `xfs:nixos`.
